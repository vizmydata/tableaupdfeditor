The goal of this project is to edit pdf generated by Tableau Desktop and Server to be able to customise pdf report
obtained from worksheet.
This because Tableau at the moment allows customisation only on dashboards but not on single sheets.
Thanks to this we can add an header, a footer and a logo to the pdf.

This makes use of:
-   tableauserverclient (https://github.com/tableau/server-client-python) for already written rest api requests
-   requests (https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) for custom http requests
-   PyPDF2 (https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2) and reportlab (https://bitbucket.org/rptlab/reportlab)
    to edit the existing pdf

The configuration is done through a file called setting.ini which has this format:

[settings]<br/>
mode = local/server<br/>
orientation = landscape/portrait<br/>
output = pdf/prova.pdf<br/>
logo = logo/tableau.png<br/>
header = PDF editing sample<br/>
footer =

Mode tells the script if the pdf we want to edit is in local or we have to generate it from Tableau Server.
Logo, header and footer are the customisations we are going to make on the pdf.
If footer is left blank a page counter will be displayed.

[local]<br/>
file = pdf/sample_portrait.pdf

Where to get the file in case of mode = local

[login]<br/>
server = <br/>
username =<br/>
password =<br/>
site =

Credentials for loggin in to Tableau Server in case of mode = server

[server]<br/>
workbook = Coffee<br/>
view = Sheet1

The view of the workbook from which we want to generate the pdf report in case of mode = server
